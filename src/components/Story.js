          My stomach was pitted with a blend of anxiety and excitement as I
          walked towards the front of my second grade classroom. I turned around
          and scanned the faces of my confused classmates, whispering amongst
          themselves about the apparent absence of a tacky tri-fold poster
          board. It was at this moment that I allowed a smile to slowly spread
          across my face. I proudly removed a two gigabyte USB flash drive from
          my pocket and showcased the red, thumb-sized device that held my
          project- a slideshow created in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003. Weeks
          prior, after watching my dad use this seemingly magical program for
          work, I became determined to master it myself.

          In an age where technology is becoming more mainstream than ever,
          where Kindergarteners are subjected to six hours of screen time each
          day for virtual learning, where it is no longer uncommon for 2nd
          graders to yield the newest model iPhone, and where a two gigabyte USB
          drive is now obsolete, a simple slide deck may no longer be
          state-of-the-art technology. Ten years ago, however, an unforgettable
          look of awe quickly spread throughout the classroom as I delivered my
          presentation on the assigned Red-Eared Slider Turtle. Little did I
          appreciate the irony of how a presentation on a slow-moving, ancient
          reptile would ignite my interest in the fast-paced, rapidly evolving
          technology industry.

          My love for computers narrowed more specifically to a passion for web
          development in sixth grade. While my technology teacher had introduced
          me to Scratch, a block-based coding platform, I knew that this fun way
          to teach kids the basics of coding was not what was used in the “real
          world.” My ambitious, sponge-like brain wanted to learn how to make
          real websites. A simple Google search of “How are websites made?” led
          me to W3schools, a platform with countless hours of programming
          tutorials and examples. I dedicated myself to learning web development
          line by line, one language at a time. I used the coins in my piggy
          bank to buy additional coding courses, starting with the basics of
          HTML and CSS, and eventually progressing into the more advanced
          JavaScript and PHP.

          The first website I ever built was a simple to-do list application.
          Modest by any standards, the basic functionality behind my project
          paled in comparison to the sense of accomplishment I achieved from
          finally getting my program to work. The same feeling I had experienced
          years prior in seeing Powerpoint for the first time resurfaced after
          watching the hours I had spent teaching myself how to code culminate
          into a finished website.

          After several years of writing thousands of lines of code, late-nights
          and early mornings spent debugging my programs, and dreams filled with
          new ideas swirling around my head, web development has grown from a
          small hobby into an integral piece of who I am. But what,
          specifically, is so enjoyable about it to me? Maybe it’s my ability to
          solve real-world problems in a unique way. Maybe it’s the way I can
          express my creativity with a monitor and keyboard rather than a canvas
          and paintbrush. Maybe it’s the endless and exhilarating rollercoaster
          of emotions I experience after finally solving a problem only to
          discover another bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe it's the journey of
          taking an idea and transforming it into a tangible product. Maybe it’s
          a combination of all of these. But the best explanation I’ve been able
          to offer myself is that it’s just “that feeling.” It is that feeling
          of curiosity, wonder, and amazement I first experienced while dazzling
          my classmates ten years ago. And it is that same feeling that fuels my
          passion to this day.
